      <question>
        What is the relation between <i>MARY</i>, <i>OpenMARY</i>, <i>MaryTTS</i>, etc.?
      </question>
      <answer>
        MARY was the original name of the project, before it was open-source.
        An open-source fork was later released under the name <i>OpenMARY</i>.
        For a while, MARY and OpenMARY were developed side-by-side;
        eventually, efforts were concentrated on the open-source version and the DFKI-internal MARY was no longer maintained.
        When OpenMARY development was migrated to GitHub, the name was changed to <i>MaryTTS</i> to highlight the project's purpose.
        <br/>
        We like to use MaryTTS to refer to the project as it exists now, but for brevity and backward compatibility, occasional references to MARY slip in.

      <question>
        Can I use MaryTTS for commercial purposes?
      </question>
      <answer>
        Yes.
        Everything needed to run MaryTTS ("marytts-runtime") is licensed under the LGPL;
        this allows commercial use, modification, and redistribution.
        We do consider it appropriate to provide attribution by inserting a notice such as
        <pre>Powered by &lt;a href="http://mary.dfki.de/"&gt;MaryTTS&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
        <b>However,</b> the voicebuilding and language building components ("marytts-builder") are licensed under the GPL;
        they rely on a number of GPL-licensed third-party libraries and tools.
        <br/>
        <b>Moreover,</b> the TTS voices themselves have individual licenses, usually Creative Commons;
        so depending on the voice's license, it may or may not be used commercially.
