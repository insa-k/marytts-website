Title: Introduction

The MARY Text-to-Speech System
==============================

MARY is an open-source, multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesis platform written in Java. 
It was originally developed as a collaborative project of [DFKI](http://www.dfki.de/web)'s [Language Technology lab](http://www.dfki.de/lt/) and [the Institute of Phonetics](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/WB/Phonetics/) at [Saarland University](http://www.uni-saarland.de) and is now being maintained by DFKI.

As of version 5.0, MARY TTS supports German, British and American English, Telugu, Turkish, Russian and Italian; more languages are in preparation. 
MARY TTS comes with toolkits for quickly [adding support for new languages](https://github.com/marytts/marytts/wiki/New-Language-Support) and for building [unit selection](https://github.com/marytts/marytts/wiki/VoiceImportToolsTutorial) and [HMM-based synthesis voices](https://github.com/marytts/marytts/wiki/HMMVoiceCreation).
