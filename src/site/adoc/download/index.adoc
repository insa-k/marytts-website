== MARY 3.x

These releases are mixed open source / research license, and mostly contain native code. +
This makes them more difficult to reuse and port to new platforms. +
Support for these releases terminates with the publication of 4.0-beta.

Older comments:

DFKI has released the core MARY system as open source, including English and Tibetan synthesis and various voices, including free unit selection voices based on the CMU Arctic databases.

In addition, German synthesis is released under a link:${project.url}/download/DFKI%20MARY%20software%20user%20agreement.html[DFKI research license].
The system can also use http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html[MBROLA] voices, under the link:${project.url}/download/Mbrola%20software%20user%20agreement.html[MBROLA license].

The interactive, web-based installer which you can download below will guide you through the installation process.
It will let you decide on the install location on your file system and will let you select the components you wish to install. +
You will need to accept the licenses appropriate for the selected components before these will actually be downloaded and installed.

The system should run on MS Windows (2000 and XP, maybe others), PC-Linux, Sun Solaris, and Mac OS X.
